This type provides efficient, 1-byte packed storage of genotypes. It supports insertions and deletions as I and D, compatibility with some bioinformation software packages. Operators for I/O have been carefully selected based on benchmarking on recent x86_64 hardware. Allele order is preserved, so the type is suitable for haplotype storage. Invalid genotypes are rejected.
